**Random Seed Phrase Generator**

This Python script generates random seed phrases by selecting words from a provided word list. Seed phrases are commonly used in cryptocurrency wallets and other applications that require a secure way to generate a series of words for backup or recovery purposes.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.x
List of Words - https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt#L580

**Usage**
1. Clone the repository or download the random_seed_phrase_generator.py file.
2. Prepare a text file containing a list of words. Each word should be on a separate line.
3. Open the random_seed_phrase_generator.py file in a text editor.
4. Modify the following variables according to your needs:
- file_path: Set the file path to the location of your word list text file.
- num_phrases: Specify the desired number of seed phrases to generate.
5. Save the modified file.
6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the random_seed_phrase_generator.py file is located.
7. Run the script by executing the following command:
``` python random_seed_phrase_generator.py```


The script will generate the specified number of seed phrases using the provided word list and display them in the terminal or command prompt.

**Example**

Assuming you have a word list text file named word_list.txt located in the same directory as the script, you can generate 10 seed phrases by setting file_path to "word_list.txt" and num_phrases to 10. When you run the script, it will output the 10 randomly generated seed phrases.

**Word List Format**

The word list file should contain one word per line. Ensure that there are no empty lines or additional characters in the file.

**Note**

It is crucial to handle the generated seed phrases with care, as they grant access to sensitive information. Store them securely and avoid sharing them in insecure environments.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements or integrate it into your own projects.

Please refer to the script comments for more detailed information on the implementation.
