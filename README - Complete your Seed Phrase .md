**Seed Phrase Completion Tool**

The Seed Phrase Completion Tool is a Python script that helps you complete an incomplete seed phrase by identifying missing words and generating possible combinations using a provided word list. This tool can be useful when you have lost or forgotten some words from your original seed phrase.

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- List of possible seed phrases - https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt#L580

**Usage**
1. Clone the repository or download the seed_phrase_completion.py file.
2. Prepare a text file containing a list of words. Each word should be on a separate line. This file will be used as the word list for completing the seed phrase. You can find that here - https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt#L580.
3. Open the seed_phrase_completion.py file in a text editor.
4. Modify the following variables according to your needs:
- file_path: Set the file path to the location of your word list text file.
5. Save the modified file.
6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the seed_phrase_completion.py file is located.
7. Run the script by executing the following command: ```python seed_phrase_completion.py```
8. Enter your incomplete seed phrase when prompted. Ensure that the seed phrase is either 24-, 18-, or 12-words long.
9. The script will check for missing words in the seed phrase and display them. If there are missing words, it will generate all possible combinations of filled seed phrases using the correct words from the word list.
10. Review the missing words and possible combinations displayed in the terminal or command prompt.
11. If the seed phrase is valid and there are missing words, you can select one of the possible combinations as a replacement for the missing words. Remember to choose combinations that make sense and align with your original seed phrase.
12. Once you have completed the missing words in your seed phrase, ensure to store the complete seed phrase securely. Treat it with the same level of security as you would your original seed phrase.

**Word List Format** 

The word list file should contain one word per line. Ensure that there are no empty lines or additional characters in the file.

**Note**
- This tool does not guarantee the correctness or validity of the completed seed phrase. It solely provides possible combinations using the provided word list.
- Always exercise caution and double-check the completed seed phrase before using it. Incorrectly completing the seed phrase may result in the loss of access to your funds or data.
- Keep the word list and the completed seed phrase secure. Avoid sharing them in insecure environments.
- This tool assumes that the provided seed phrase follows the BIP39 standard for mnemonic phrases.

Acknowledgments
This tool is inspired by the need to recover or complete seed phrases when some words are missing. If you have been in a bad situation where one or more words in your seed phrase is incorrect, this tool might help out. It builds upon the concept of mnemonic phrases used in cryptocurrency wallets.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements or integrate it into your own projects.

Please refer to the script comments for more detailed information on the implementation.
